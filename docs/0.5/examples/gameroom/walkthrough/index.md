# Gameroom Technical Walkthrough

***NOTE:*** This document is a work in progress! We are updating the
walkthrough with details for Splinter 0.4 and converting it to Markdown. For
a complete version of the document, see the [Gameroom Technical Walkthrough
PDF](https://files.splinter.dev/docs/Gameroom_Walkthrough-Splinter_v0.3.4.pdf).

## Introduction

Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to revolutionize how businesses
communicate and transact. At Cargill, we are leading the revolution with
involvement in several open-source projects, including Hyperledger Sawtooth,
Hyperledger Transact, and Splinter. This document outlines an example application,
Gameroom, that uses technologies from each of these projects to demonstrate our
vision of using smart contracts to enhance business and customer relationships.

Privacy and confidentiality between trading partners are important capabilities
for (almost) all multi-party interactions. These capabilities are especially
critical in distributed applications. As a result, the technology stack behind
Gameroom differs from a common "shared-everything" blockchain design; instead,
it sculpts the underlying blockchain-like distributed ledger technology into a
sophisticated architecture that shares data only between the appropriate
participants. Parts of this walkthrough are written as a script, in several acts,
for which we recommend a dramatic reading (as if performed on stage by very
amateur actors). Each act is followed by a "behind the scenes" chapter that
describes the complex underlying technology and explains what really happens
when running the deceptively simple Gameroom application. A glossary at the end
defines the terms used by Splinter and the Gameroom application.

**Note**: This document is based on Splinter version 0.3.4. As Splinter matures,
some details may change (such as the exact format of messages).

## The Cast

**Alice**, an employee at Acme Corporation

**Bob**, a project leader at Bubba Bakery

**Yoda**, a VP at Yoyodyne Systems

**Zixi**, head of IT at Zymogen Industries

## The Setting
Two Splinter nodes are set up, one at Acme Corporation and one at Bubba Bakery.
Alice and Bob have each registered as a Gameroom user with an email address, a
private key, and a password. The Prequel explains the details of node setup and
user registration.

## Prologue: An Initial Conversation

ALICE, sitting in an office chair at a desk. MACBOOK PRO. Aging
desk PHONE. Alice picks up the receiver. Dials a phone number.

ALICE

Hi Bob.

Long pause. Alice rolls her eyes.

ALICE

Anyway, we need to get moving on setup -- yeah --
sure, it is a bit silly, but we need to prove how our
companies can use this new technology. We'll use the
gameroom to play a few games of --

Another pause. Alice sighs.

ALICE

Yes, we have to show that we can create a private and
secure connection between our two companies.
How about I send you -- right, I'll create the
gameroom and you'll see my invitation in your app.
Alice logs into her Mac. Starts up the BROWSER and clicks on
the ACME GAMEROOM bookmark. Browser displays a network error.

ALICE

One second; I got this Mac from IT but it doesnâ€™t
have access to the corporate network -- yeah, I know.
Actually, just let me know if you don't get my
invitation in a few minutes -- Fine. OK, bye.

Alice hangs up the phone.

Alice pushes the Macbook aside. Reaches into her bag and heaves
out a Windows notebook. It looks old. Alice opens it up. Logs
in. Starts up the BROWSER and clicks on the ACME GAMEROOM
bookmark. The app starts to load.

## Act I: Alice and Bob Create a Gameroom

### Scene 1: Alice logs into Acme's Gameroom application

Alice looks at the GAMEROOM APP LOGIN SCREEN in her browser.

![](./images/acme_gameroom_login_screen.svg "Gameroom app Acme login screen")

Alice enters her EMAIL and PASSWORD. Clicks LOG IN.

Success. The browser now displays the ACME GAMEROOM HOME SCREEN.

## Behind the Scenes: A Look at Act I, Alice and Bob Create a Gameroom

### I-1. Behind scene 1: Alice logs into Acme's Gameroom UI

Gameroom uses Biome for user management, including authentication. For more
information, check out the [Biome
overview](../../../concepts/biome_user_management.md).

When a user logs in, the user interface (UI) component of the Gameroom client
application works with the Gameroom REST API to check the user's email address
and password and to ensure the user has a public and private key pair. Each
Gameroom client communicates with a Gameroom daemon, using the Gameroom REST API
in order to authenticate a Gameroom user. The Gameroom REST API uses the Biome
REST API to authenticate the user credentials and to fetch key pairs associated
with the user. Biome is a part of the Acme Splinter daemon. Each Splinter daemon
stores the user credentials and keys in a local PostgreSQL database; user
passwords are hashed by the Gameroom client so that they remain secret.

#### I-1.1. Acme UI sends authorization request to Gameroom REST API

![](./images/auth_login_acme1.svg "Gameroom daemon receives auth request")

When Alice clicks Log in, the Acme Gameroom UI hashes the password, then sends
an authorization request to the Acme Gameroom daemon, gameroomd. The Gameroom
daemon then makes several requests to the Biome REST API to verify the user.

The following request is sent to Acme's Gameroom daemon:

```
POST /users/authenticate
{
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "hashedPassword": "8e066d41...d99ada0d"
}
```

The UI does not reveal the user's password to the REST API because the password
is used to encrypt signing keys (as described in section I-2.3, step 5).

#### I-1.2. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to verify password

![](./images/auth_login_acme2.svg "Gameroom daemon forwards auth request")

Once the Gameroom daemon receives the authentication request, the actual
authentication is handled by the Biome REST API. This authentication request
is sent from the Acme Gameroom daemon to the Biome REST API.

```
POST /biome/login
{
  "username": "alice@acme.com",
  "hashed_password": "56ec82cb...480cad32"
}
```

When the Biome REST API receives the authorization request for Alice, it fetches
the entry from the Acme Splinter daemon's local database associated with the
username and verifies the hashed password sent in the request.


![](./images/auth_login_acme3.svg "Splinter daemon verifies Alice's credentials")


The `user_credentials` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_credentials (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `user_credentials` table:

| `user_id` | `username` | `password` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3` | `alice@acme.com` | `56ec82cb...480cad32` |


If the hashed password from the authentication request passes verification,
the Biome REST API will respond with a success response. This response includes
JSON Web Tokens, which enable the Gameroom REST API to make authorized requests
to the Biome REST API, without requiring the user to enter their password.
The refresh token included in the success response allows a new access token to
be issued, if the refresh token has not expired, when the original token issued
has expired. Each refresh token issued is saved to the `refresh_tokens` table in
the Splinter daemon database, with an associated user ID.

The `refresh_tokens` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS refresh_tokens (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    token TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `refresh_tokens` table:

| `id` | `user_id` | `token` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1` | `06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3` | `zeFgbILi...opBrt4ic` |

If the credentials are verified, the Biome REST API will respond with the
following success response:

``` json
{
  "message": "Successful login",
  "user_id": "06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3",
  "token": "eyJhbGci...adQssw5c",
  "refresh_token": "zeFgbILi...opBrt4ic",
}
```

#### I-1.3. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to request Alice's key pairs

![](./images/auth_login_acme4.svg "Gameroom daemon requests Alice's keys")

Once the Gameroom daemon has verified Alice's password, it must then verify that
Alice has a public and private key pair. Alice's public and private key pair was
added to the Acme Splinter database during registration (see The Prequel,
section P.2).

The request to list Alice's associated keys is made to the Biome REST API.

```
GET /biome/keys
```

The request to the Biome REST API's keys endpoint holds Alice's
JSON Web Token in an `Authorization` header, which will enable the Splinter
daemon to authorize access to the user's key information, as well as extract the
user ID from the token to fetch the keys from the Splinter daemon's database.


![](./images/auth_login_acme5.svg "Splinter daemon retrieves Alice's keys")


The `keys` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS keys (
    public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(public_key, user_id)
);
```

Using the unique `user_id` from the access token, the keys associated with Alice
are fetched from the Splinter daemon's database.

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `keys` table:

| `display_name` | `user_id` | `public_key` | `encrypted_private_key` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|`alice@acme.com`|`06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3`|`0384781f...5a7e4998`|`{\"iv\":...cgXrm\"}`|


If the associated entry is found in the Splinter database `keys` table, a success
response with the list of key information is sent back to the Gameroom daemon.

``` json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "public_key": "0384781f...5a7e4998",
      "user_id": "06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3",
      "display_name": "alice@acme.com",
      "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...cgXrm\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### I-1.4. Gameroom REST API returns login success response

If the Gameroom REST API gets a successful response from both requests sent to
the Biome REST API to verify the user, then the authentication was successful.

The Gameroom REST API sends a response to the Acme UI that contains Alice's
public key and encrypted private key.

``` json
{
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "public_key": "0384781f...5a7e4998",
  "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...cgXrm\"}",
}
```

Next, the UI must gather the information for the Acme Gameroom home screen that
Alice will see after logging in.

#### I-1.5. Acme UI requests a list of gamerooms

After a user has been authenticated, the UI gathers user-specific information for
the home screen. First, it requests the list of existing gamerooms for that user.
(At this point, no gamerooms exist.) Later, this walkthrough will describe what
happens when there are gamerooms for the UI to display.

1. When Alice logs in, the Acme UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the
list of gamerooms.

```
GET /api/gamerooms
```

2. This call returns an empty list, since there are no gamerooms in the Acme
Gameroom's PostgreSQL database.

``` json
{
  "data": [],
  "paging": {
    "current": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 100,
    "total": 0,
    "first": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
    "prev": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
    "next": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
    "last": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0"
  }
}
```

#### I-1.6. Acme UI requests a list of invitations
Next, the Acme Gameroom UI requests the list of gameroom invitations. In this
scenario, Alice has no invitations, so the list is empty. Later, the walkthrough
will show what happens when a user has unaccepted invitations.

1. When Alice logs in, the UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the list
of invitations (also called _circuit proposals_).

```
GET /api/proposals
```

2. Because Alice has no invitations, the Gameroom REST API returns an empty list.

``` json
{
  "data": [],
  "paging": {
    "current": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 100,
    "total": 0,
    "first": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
    "prev": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
    "next": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
    "last": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0"
  }
}
```

At this point, Alice sees the Acme Gameroom home screen with no existing
gamerooms or invitations.
