NAME
====

**splinter-circuit** â€” Provides circuit management functionality.

SYNOPSIS
========
**splinter circuit** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**SUBCOMMAND**\]

DESCRIPTION
===========
This command allows nodes to create and manage circuits and circuit proposals.
Commands to list and display circuits and circuit proposals that a node is a member
of are also available subcommands. Nodes are also able to vote to accept or reject
circuit proposals using the `splinter-circuit-vote` subcommand.

FLAGS
=====
`-h`, `--help`
: Prints help information

`-q`, `--quiet`
: Decrease verbosity (the opposite of -v). When specified, only errors or
  warnings will be output.

`-V`, `--version`
: Prints version information

`-v`
: Increases verbosity (the opposite of -q). Specify multiple times for more
  output.

SUBCOMMANDS
===========
`default`
: Manage default values for circuit creation.

`list`
: List all circuits that have been accepted by all proposed members.

`proposals`
: List all circuit proposals. Circuit proposals have not been voted on by all
  proposed members.

`propose`
: Propose a new circuit to be created.

`show`
: Display a specific circuit or circuit proposal.

`template`
: Manage circuit templates used for circuit creation.

`vote`
: Vote on a new circuit proposal. Only the proposed members that did not propose
  the circuit are able to vote on a circuit. The circuit requester has an assumed
  vote of `ACCEPT`.
